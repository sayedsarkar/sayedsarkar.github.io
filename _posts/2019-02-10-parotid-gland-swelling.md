Posted by Nenufar on 2010-10-27

Need professional advice, please help!

34 years old female, 165 lbs, 5'6' (or 1.70 m)

Left parotid gland swelling with every meal, little pain, need to massage gland for saliva to come out. When saliva comes out it has a bitter taste. Problem started 3 years ago. Happened every other month, then every other week and now is almost every day. ENT doctor did a manual dilatation of the salivary duct today and the inflammation got worse, pain is worse and I cannot drain the duct with massage any more.

Other general symptoms are:

Severe nasal (dust, pets, mold, changes in temperature).<br>
Recurrent sinus infections with itchy throat.<br>
Facial since teenage years.<br>
Small skin tags and wart kind of skin growths on chest and neck area.<br>
Uncontrollable cravings, will eat until I cannot do it any more. Craves bread and butter, and spicy/hot food. Tends to gain weight due to eating disorder.<br>
Irritable, moody, hates contradiction.<br>
Perfectionist, cannot overcome failure.<br>
Obsessive.<br>
Black bags around eyes since childhood.
Cracked and white coated tongue with teeth marks on both sides.
Bad breath.<br>
Tendency to swell mostly in warm weather.<br>
Likes warmth of the bed, likes dark, quiet rooms.<br>
Dislikes company.<br>
Worried about future.<br>
Menstrual period suppressed because I have a IUD (mirena).<br>

A few months ago a friend of mine told me to take , did it and immediately I had a menstrual discharge and my mood got better but after a while the moodiness came back. I tried lyc 200c and I got a horrible leg pain, sore throat that lasted 4 weeks and my acne got worse.

Yes, you can take . Sol. 200c in pills form.

One dose means:

Get a 500ml bottle of distilled Water from the nearest supermarket. Pour out about 250 ml of water from the bottle to leave some airspace. Insert 1 pills (If the remedy is in pills form) from the remedy into the bottle and shake the bottle hard 10 times in a row (10 strokes of equal strength). Shaking the bottle hard is homeopathic succession which is done to enhance the medicinal power of the remedy.

Please take only 5 drops of the reconstituted dilution of 250 ml using a disposable dropper 3 times at a gap of 3 hours. This is to be done for one day only.

Please shake the bottle hard 10 times in a row (10 strokes of equal strength) every time before taking 5 drops from this bottle using a disposable dropper which can be used as a dose.

Please store the unused portion of reconstituted remedy dilution in a cool and dry place (below 30˚ temperature), protected from light, smell of all kind of food/medicine/herbs, chemicals, etc. You will need it later.

2/. If your remedy came in pills form do not touch the pills with your hands, tip them into the cap of the container they came in and then into the water.
3/. Avoid coffee, tea (including green), and other sources of caffeine such as some fizzy drinks and large amounts of chocolate, except where this would cause a drastic change in consumption
4/. Avoid wearing perfume or exposure to anything with a strong smell on the day and 3 days following the remedy administration. This includes any and all essential oils, and incense.

Dear Rahiq,

7 days have passed since I tried the remedy, I was able to find the liquid dilution after all. Took the remedy on Friday 10/29. The pain was severe that day and the day before, I did not eat 2-3 days to avoid the pain.
After taking the remedy I observed the following:
- No drastic or immediate changes.
- Friday night 10/29 I noticed a itchy sensation on my left eye (tear duct)- which used to swell several years ago after some type of allergic reaction.
- Saturday night 10/30 the gland duct was UNBLOCKED and was able to manually drain the saliva which had an unpleasant taste.
- Sunday 10/31 - Bad tasting saliva kept draining from the gland and I was able to eat without excessive swelling and pain.
- Monday 11/1 - Gland was back to normal, no swelling, did not need to manually drain it.
- Tuesday 11/2 - Itchy thoat, cough with burntaste, hoarse voice (all these symptoms lasted only 2 days and were minor)

Overall, the gland is doing well, I don't notice anymore when saliva comes out, no swelling at all. I only have a minor pulsating pain that comes and goes. My moodiness is gone, my fluid retention is gone. I have two more question for you? Is a specific remedy for an acute gland obstruction or is it a constitutional remedy for me? Would you recommend taking the same dose if the problem comes back?

I really appreciate your advice and the time you spent on my case. It meant a lot to me as I was in terrrible pain.

Sincerely,
Norma (Real Name)

Dear Norma,

&gt; Is a specific remedy for an acute gland obstruction or is it a constitutional remedy for me?

It’s hard to say that Merc. Sol. is your constitutional remedy but I can tell you that Merc. Sole. is the best suited remedy for your present condition.

&gt; Would you recommend taking the same dose if the problem comes back?

Sorry to say, No!

If the problem come back, may be it will come with some changed symptoms which can indicate to same remedy or any other remedy according to overall physical and mental condition.

So, please inform us before taking any more doses of Merc. Sol. or any other remedy whatever the cause is.

Please report back after 15 days.
